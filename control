Description: more powerful, open-source SummerBoard
 This tool lets you give your device a graphical overhaul. Themes are taken from /Library/Themes (or, now, the older SummerBoard folder). Using the relatively simple frontend you can activate and deactivate multiple themes and give them a priority ordering.
 
 WinterBoard was designed to accept <a href="http://www.apptapp.com/summerboard/">SummerBoard</a> themes without modification but is <strong>much</strong> more powerful than its predecessor. With WinterBoard you can theme almost any graphic on the system. You can even easily modify .artwork files without having to hack their contents, all from the safety of your theme folder.
