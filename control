Description: more powerful, open-source SummerBoard
 After you install or uninstall this package you will have to /reboot/ (seriously, REBOOT) your phone to it to take effect.
 
 This tool lets you apply SummerBoard themes. Themes are taken from /Library/Themes (or, now, the older SummerBoard folder). Right now the front-end for selecting themes is /very/ simplistic: I have spent only a couple days coding this and almost all of that time has been on the backend.
 
 More work will be done on this package in the very near future to make it actually have an interface ;P.
 
 WinterBoard is /much/ more powerful than SummerBoard and lets you theme almost any graphic on the system. You can even easily theme .artwork files without having to hack their contents. Instructions on how this works will be posted soon on the More Information page.
